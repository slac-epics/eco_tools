R1.2	2017-02-02 Bruce Hill

			No for PCDS dest paths, 	Yes for LCLS
	Reorganized a bit to consolidate some cookie cutter code blocks to one function.

		use our git repo template when creating new bare repos.

R1.0	2017-01-14 Bruce Hill
	Took EPICS_BASE_VER out of RELEASE_SITE as R3.15 doesn't like to see two different
		macros w/ the same value like BASE_MODULE_VERSION and EPICS_BASE_VER
	Fixed some issues re when to create vs delete a local build branch created from the tag.
	Reworked the fixPermissions code to use python modules instead of shell commands
		and cleaned up some status and diagnostic messages for a better user experience.
	Added a nifty git script, git-branch-status, I found that makes it easy to keep track
		of whether your branches are ahead or behind their upstream branch.
	Fixed shell setup scripts for epics-build, epics-checkout, etc to run the version
		in the setup script directory instead of always going to TOOLS_SITE_TOP/eco_tools.
		Allows development to be done by simply sourcing the add-to-env,sh script.
	Updates to eco:
		Now it's a soft link to bash script that runs epics-checkout.py.
		There's also a soft link called epics-checkout to the same launch script.
		The command line options are the same as the prior eco script.

		However, now the first choice when epics-checkout searchs for the package
		location is a git repo, if available.
		The rational for this is tht the initial import of a cvs or svn package
		to git is easy and doesn't take long.  Once in git, it's easier to do
		any new work using git, using lcls-trunk or pcds-trunk as needed till the
		merge is complete.
		The next stop on the search list is $TOOLS/eco_modulelist/modulelist.txt.
		If epics-checkout is having trouble finding your module, add a convenient
		shortcut name in eco_modulelist.
		Then CVS, and finally svn.
		If the package isn't found in any of those, it errors out.
	New EPICS utility scripts added:
	epics-build:
		Soft link to bash script that runs epics-build.py.
		Allows building one or more module releases either via command line or via a batch file.
	epics-versions:
		Soft link to bash script that runs epics-versions.py.
		Searches for the most current (or all) releases of one or more modules.
		Can also show module dependencies via -v option
		Also works for base, ioc/<IOC_NAME>, and some other common patterns
	epics-release:
		Soft link to bash script that runs epics-release.py.
		Rework of a PCDS svn script that facilitates creating epics releases in a std fashion w/ one easy command
